                <b>ACAS/TCAS</b><br /><br />

                When a pilot reports a manoeuvre induced by an RA the controller should remember the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>The controller shall not attempt to modify the aircraft flight path until the pilot reports "Clear of Conflict"</li>
                    <li>The controller shall provide traffic information as appropriate</li>
                    <li>Pilots are very busy (Increased workload in the cockpit)</li>
                    <li>Pilot would experience stress in the face of conflicting traffic, even if alerted through ACAS traffic advisories</li>
                    <li>TCAS II altitude data is more accurate than radar data</li>
                    <li>TCAS II evaluates the strength of an RA every second and will change it if necessary</li>
                </ul><br />
                
                The controller shall resume responsibility for providing separation for all the affected aircraft when:
                <ul>
                    <li> the controller acknowledges a report from the flight crew that the aircraft has resumed the current clearance; or</li>
                    <li>the controller acknowledges a report from the flight crew that the aircraft is resuming the current clearance and issues an alternative clearance which is acknowledged by the flight crew.</li>
                </ul><br />  
    

                Circumstances following an effective ACAS RA, pilot and controller RTF interchange:<br /><br />
                After a flight crew starts to deviate from any ATC clearance or instruction to comply with an ACAS RA:<br />
                PILOT: [callsign] TCAS RA; <br />
                ATC: [callsign] ROGER;<br /><br />


                After the response to an ACAS RA is completed and a return to the ATC clearance or instruction is initiated:<br />

                PILOT: [callsign] CLEAR OF CONFLICT, RETURNING TO.. (assigned clearance);<br />

                ATC: [callsign] ROGER (or alternative instructions); <br /><br />


                After the response to an ACAS RA is completed and the assigned ATC clearance or instruction has been resumed:<br />

                PILOT: [callsign] CLEAR OF CONFLICT (assigned clearance) RESUMED;<br />

                ATC: [callsign] ROGER (or alternative instructions); <br /><br />


                After an ATC clearance or instruction contradictory to the ACAS RA is received, the flight crew will follow the RA and inform ATC directly:<br />

                PILOT: [callsign] UNABLE, TCAS RA; <br />

                ATC: [callsign] ROGER; <br />
